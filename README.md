# Climate Change Impact on Agricultural Land

## Introduction
Climate change significantly affects agricultural land, altering soil quality, water availability, crop yields, and pest patterns. Rising global temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events are key contributors.

## Line-by-Line Explanation of Climate Change Impact

1. **Rising Temperatures:**
   - Higher temperatures lead to increased evaporation, reducing soil moisture.
   - Crops that require cool climates struggle to grow, leading to yield reductions.
   - Heat stress affects pollination and plant growth, reducing productivity.

2. **Altered Rainfall Patterns:**
   - Some regions experience excessive rainfall, leading to soil erosion and nutrient leaching.
   - Droughts increase due to irregular rainfall, reducing groundwater levels.
   - Water availability becomes unpredictable, impacting irrigation systems.

3. **Extreme Weather Events:**
   - Storms, hurricanes, and floods damage crops and farmland.
   - Unpredictable frosts and heatwaves affect crop cycles.
   - Increased risk of natural disasters reduces farming stability.

4. **Soil Degradation:**
   - Higher temperatures and heavy rains cause soil erosion and loss of fertility.
   - Excessive rainfall washes away essential nutrients, leading to poor crop growth.
   - Desertification increases, reducing the amount of arable land.

5. **Pest and Disease Proliferation:**
   - Warmer temperatures extend the lifecycle and geographic range of pests.
   - Increased humidity fosters plant diseases, reducing crop resilience.
   - Farmers need more pesticides, raising production costs and environmental risks.

6. **Reduced Crop Yields:**
   - Climate-sensitive crops, such as wheat and maize, show reduced productivity.
   - Extreme heat affects flowering and grain-filling stages, leading to lower yields.
   - Declining productivity threatens global food security and farmer incomes.

## How to Run the Code

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed and the required libraries:
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn numpy matplotlib
```

### Running the Streamlit App
1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```
2. **Run the Streamlit app:**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
3. **Open the Web App:**
   - The terminal will display a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`).
   - Open it in your web browser to interact with the app.



## Conclusion
Understanding the impact of climate change on agricultural land is crucial for food security. This project provides an interactive tool for analyzing climate and agricultural trends using machine learning. Feel free to contribute and improve the model!
